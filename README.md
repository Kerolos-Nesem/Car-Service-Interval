## Summary

Car-Service-Interval is an app to help consumer understand and know when and what service should be done on their car given the approximate current mileage. Car-Service-Interval also aims to bring peace of mind to the consumer knowing that they aren't being ripped off or they're being taken advatnage of based off what they know (or don't). 

## Users

This app is for anyone with a car that doesn't know their car service intervals. Also this is for anyone who feels like they're being up-sold services all the time at their mechanics shop that they don't need. 

## Problem Solving

While there are famous websites like KBB that ease the buying/selling of a car, there aren't any that help the consumers understand/know when and what needs to be done given the mileage. There are a lot of blogs that give a general idea of what should be done and sometimes they can be confusing. Wouldn't it be easier if you just chose the mileage closest to your current mileage and were told exactly what needs to be done? That is the goal of CSI.
